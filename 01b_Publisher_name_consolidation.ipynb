    "## Handling publishers\n",
    "Publishers are not uniquely defined in Unpaywall's data. This is a problem because it means that, if we want to look at what individual publishers are doing with regard to OA, we might only get part of the picture when a publisher has more than 1 name in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few possible ways to solve this. E.g. one could cross-reference with CrossRef and use the CrossRef member-ids to disambiguate publishers, but that might take a lot of time and there's the further problem that some publishers also have more than 1 CrossRef member id.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we will try an ad-hoc solution of simply searching the complete publishers list in the Unpaywall data to see if we can find name variants and imprint names for major publishers. This is certainly going to yield imperfect results, but checking against the major publishers' websites shows that the totals are close enough. "
