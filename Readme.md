# Unpaywall data analysis

This repo contains some Jupyter notebooks to help with some basic analyses of Unpaywall data. 

In order to use the notebooks, you will need to download a copy of the latest Unpaywall snapshot. The notebooks were written using the 2021-02-18 dataset. Note that if you use a future dataset and the structure of the data changes, then you will need to edit the code accordingly.
